## next version

* Add script `qconf-json2sharetree` to transform a JSON
  sharetree specification into a format understood by
  `qconf`.
* [BUG] Queue master not included automatically in the
  list of client nodes.

## 0.5.1

Cookbook failed due to inplace `uniq!`.

## 0.5.0

Since this cookbook is a redesign of a Grid Engine 
cookbook used for the last two years, I consider it
to be at least half ready for production.
